Brennan, who currently represents District 2 on the council, is running for his fourth term.

Since joining the body in 2014, Brennan has teamed up with other council members to plan the construction of the new city hall, been a strong advocate for public art in the community and worked to create new, environmentally conscious sidewalks in the city.

“I really enjoy serving our city and being a reliable point of contact for my neighbors,” Brennan said.

He’s proud of his work involving voter accessibility — he has supported early voting, the city’s addition of voting centers and the establishment of a polling location at the university.

If reelected, he wants to see the city explore same-day voter registration on Election Day to improve voter accessibility. He also wants to work with students to advance projects addressing the need for affordable housing.

Brennan said his campaign centers on three main issues — community engagement, smart growth and quality of life — just like it did in 2017.

Community engagement, he said, involves communication between the city and its residents, while smart growth addresses city development. Quality of life, Brennan said, refers to things such as taxes on the community, the community’s impact on climate issues and most recently, regulating noise and nuisances.

These issues aren’t things that are “solved,” but things the city must continually work on to meet residents’ needs, Brennan said. He hopes to continue addressing these challenges if elected for a fourth term.

“It is a really incredible time to live in our city,” Brennan said. “We have a lot of different perspectives to balance as a council, so it’s very challenging, but it’s also very exciting.”
