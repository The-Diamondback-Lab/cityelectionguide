District 3
true
"We want this to be a home where people don't want to leave, and they want to be here forever."

Robert Day, who currently represents District 3, is running for his fifth term.

He said he hopes to develop affordable housing and attract restaurants and other businesses to set up shop in the city. He’s also pushing for better communication between the council and the public, improved public safety and a stronger school system.

“I'm not going to say I make every single person happy, but I want to listen to them,” Day said. “I'm going to try and develop a path forward where both sides move back towards the middle to address the issues in a fair and equitable way.”

Day is proud of his work in helping to establish College Park Academy, a charter middle and high school that was a collaborative project with the university. He hopes the school’s model, which includes a mixture of online and in-person learning, is used throughout Prince George’s County.

If elected to another term, he hopes to improve traffic on Route 1, and make the city appealing as a pit stop on the highway — a major thoroughfare that stretches from Florida to Maine. He wants the city to be “a destination,” rather than a place people pass through.

“We want this to be a home where people don't want to leave, and they want to be here forever,” he said.
