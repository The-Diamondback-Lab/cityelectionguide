Denise Mitchell, who currently serves as a District 4 councilmember, is running for her sixth nonconsecutive term.

A College Park resident since 1975, Mitchell served on the council for six years before running for mayor and losing in 2015. She also served as mayor pro tem from 2013 to 2015.

In addition, Mitchell also worked in the education field for over 30 years — she’s previously served as chair of the city’s education advising committee and on the College Park Academy founding board, among other positions.

“My record speaks for itself,” Mitchell said. “I’ve always listened. I voted for what the residents expect me to vote for. I have been engaged, I have been accountable and I have been transparent.”

As a council member, Mitchell pushed for a spending cap on the construction of the new city hall, but it did not go through. If reelected, her goals would be to obtain tax credits for long-term homeowners, prevent construction on the University of Maryland golf course and improve pedestrian safety on Metzerott Road.

Mitchell also wants to see through the development of a community center in College Park Woods, evaluate the pros and cons of creating a College Park police force and bolster the city’s internship program.

“This is my home,” Mitchell said. “I’m not going anywhere. I am here to actively fight for and support my constituents.”
