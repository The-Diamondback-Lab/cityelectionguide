"I would like to see people more engaged, because they actually count."

Gregory is now in the midst of his third run for College Park City Council. He ran for District 4 in 2015 and 2017, and after a move to Berwyn, he’s now running for District 2.

His campaign is centered on strengthening the community by engaging the residents of local neighborhoods. The city council is pushing to urbanize College Park, Gregory said, but the neighborhoods aren’t receiving similar attention. Developers have saturated the area with big buildings and shopping centers, he said.

Newer developments, such as the Riverdale Park Station shopping center, Gregory said, aren’t built to last. There’s a lack of surrounding infrastructure and there aren’t enough people to sustain it.

“Eventually, they’ll get tired of the same pizza and they’ll go someplace else,” he said.

Gregory is prioritizing tax reductions, while also focusing on safety and the environment. He also plans to push for lower tuition at the University of Maryland — something he wouldn’t have the power to change directly, he noted, but could advocate for outside of the city.

He said College Park should be a city that takes care of its residents. His vision for the city includes green space instead of developments and an engaged community of residents and students.

“I would like to see people more engaged, because they actually count,” he said. “Their voices count, their opinions count.”

Gregory remembers summer nights in the 1970s: He and the other neighborhood teenagers would leave their houses for a walk through the streets. He remembers the warm air, good conversation and the “knuckleheads” who used to pull out the beer.

“It was just honest-to-God community,” he said. “And you couldn’t ask for anything better.”
