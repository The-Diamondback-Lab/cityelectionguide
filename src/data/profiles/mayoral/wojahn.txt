"There’s a lot more that we have left to do."

Incumbent Patrick Wojahn is running for his third term as mayor of College Park. Last election, he won the most contested mayoral race in the city’s history, beating out three other candidates.

Over his four years as mayor, Wojahn said one of the things he’s most proud of is enhancing the partnership between the city and the University of Maryland. One way he said he’s done that is through his work on “getting City Hall across the finish line.”

After years of planning, the construction of College Park’s new city hall is moving forward — a project the city and the university are working together to complete. It’s expected to be finished in 2022.

If reelected, Wojahn wants to keep making the city a more attractive place to live by enhancing areas in the city other than downtown and the Hollywood Commercial District, which Wojahn said the council has focused on for years.

Wojahn’s campaign also centers on sustainability, as he believes climate change is “one of the greatest challenges we face.” As mayor, he wants to work toward decreasing College Park’s environmental impact by looking at its stormwater management system and improving its bike lanes and trail networks.

In addition, Wojahn wants to find new ways to interact with residents outside of council meetings. He said he hopes to utilize social media and other “non-traditional means” to let residents know the city is “here to serve them,” and that he and council members want to hear their input and ideas.

“We’ve started a lot, there’s a lot more that we have left to do.” he said. “I would be honored and humbled to be able to continue the work that we’ve done.”
