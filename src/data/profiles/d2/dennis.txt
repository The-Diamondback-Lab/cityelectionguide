"I want to help the community, and I want to give back to the community."

Dennis is about to complete his eighth year as a District 2 council member.

He said he is most proud of his previous work as a consensus builder between his colleagues on the council. He said he works to help the council collaborate and be a more cohesive body, and he encourages partnerships and team building.

Dennis said he originally became interested in local government through his involvement with the Lakeland Civic Association, where he often worked with the mayor and council. He said after people asked him to get involved in the council, he decided to run.

“I want to help the community, and I want to give back to the community,” Dennis said.

His campaign touches on “quality of life” issues, which Dennis said is an umbrella term for many things in the community.

Specifically, he wants to focus on activities and assistance for seniors. He wants to see senior social events enhanced, and Neighbors Helping Neighbors — a program that provides transportation for seniors to things such as doctors appointments — “ramped up.”

Dennis, who was excited about the level of turnout at early voting on Oct. 27, said he hopes residents continue to be engaged.

“I hope that folks — that our residents — all over the city are sufficiently informed, that they will come out and vote on election day,” Dennis said.
