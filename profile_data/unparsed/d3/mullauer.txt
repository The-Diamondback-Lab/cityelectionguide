This is Mark Mullauer’s first time running for a position. A resident since 2007, Mullauer first became involved in local government when his parking cost was changed from $10 biannually to $60 a month after the construction of Terrapin Row apartments.

Unable to afford the new cost, Mullauer argued to the council, and said they admitted “they didn’t do enough due diligence” when looking at the effects of the change in pricing.

Since then, Mullauer said, the council “hasn’t changed much,” and now he thinks it’s time for a fresh face.

Mullauer said one of the main focuses of his campaign is safety. He observed a meeting where the mayor and council spoke with the police about the security camera system downtown. But he felt like the current council was leaning toward the option that would save them the most money — cameras that would record for later playback, but wouldn’t allow live monitoring.

“You can’t put a price on safety,” he said.

He hopes to work toward bringing the community together — something that’s even more important after the council’s recent decision to ban “unruly social gatherings” in the city, which he said “pitted the area against each other.”

“I don’t think what they did was exactly the best option, and I’d really like to work with residents and students to find a better way to revise that,” he said.

Mullauer said he hopes to see a high voter turnout across the board — but emphasized the importance of students casting their ballots.

“It would be a privilege to represent them,” he said.
