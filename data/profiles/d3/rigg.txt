"I’m passionate about the city and about its residents and about making it a better place."

Rigg is a current District 3 council member running for his second term. Prior to his election, Rigg served five years as president of the Calvert Hills Citizens Association and two years on the Advisory Planning Commission, which makes recommendations for the city’s long-term development, among other responsibilities.

“I’m passionate about College Park,” Rigg said. “I’m passionate about the city and about its residents and about making it a better place.”

In his first term on the council, Rigg advocated for the preservation of land on Albion Road and pushed for the “unruly social gatherings” ban. He’s also collaborated with Greek life students to reduce break-ins over school breaks, protected funding for security cameras in Old Town and worked to improve bike and pedestrian access to the Riverdale Park Station.

“Neighborhood safety and neighborhood quality of life have been at the core of what I’ve been trying to do over the past two years,” Rigg said.

His campaign is centered on attracting more year-round residents, he said — working to bring more non-students to help businesses stay afloat during the summer months. He aims to support affordable housing, sustainability and small and minority-owned businesses.

“I’m good at policy, but I’m mostly good at policy because I work hard, to be honest with you,” Rigg said. “I’m very eager to hear from all stakeholders, and I try to accommodate their concerns whenever I can.”
