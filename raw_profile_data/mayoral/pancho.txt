"Everyone has a voice."

Although Nikesha Pancho has never run for public office before, she’s been involved at the “grassroots level of every part of government” for years.

“I decided to run for mayor so that I could take what I’ve been doing at the grassroots level to a higher level,” said Pancho, who has experience in mental health counseling and fitness training and also mentors young people in her community.

She pitches herself as an advocate. She wants to push for measures that support young people — particularly those who don’t see college as a future for themselves — and help the homeless, specifically homeless veterans.

If elected, Pancho wants to improve communication with the community and make sure residents feel heard and represented in the city government. She said she wants to give University of Maryland students opportunities to sit down with council members and residents and have conversations outside of meetings.

While Pancho didn’t elaborate on specific measures she'd like to pursue, she said her main strategy for creating policies would be seeking input from her constituents. In fact, the message of her campaign is “I’m Listening” — something she doesn’t think current city leaders do enough.

“I believe our voices aren’t being heard, and I believe elected officials are supposed to listen to all voices, not just one voice, or their own voice,” Pancho said. “Everyone has a voice.”

To campaign, Pancho has been riding her “little red scooter” door-to-door in the city, toting flyers and signs. She said she’s been speaking with community members to show them the passion she has for bettering the city.

“I’m excited about running. I’m excited about working for the residents, the taxpayers and the students in this community,” Pancho said.
