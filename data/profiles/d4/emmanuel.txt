"We need an opposing voice on the council."

This is Emmanuel’s first time running for a city-level position. A University of Maryland graduate, he previously served as the academic affairs vice president on the Student Governance Board.

He was motivated to run because he thought the council needed new faces, voices and ideas.

“Most of them vote the same way,” Emmanuel said of the current council members, “so I think we need an opposing voice on the council so that they’re able to challenge them.”

His campaign centers around public safety, education and strengthening community involvement. Emmanuel said that while education is something addressed at the county level, the city should still be making its voice heard in terms of improving teacher benefits and academic performance, especially in mathematics.

Emmanuel said he believes the council doesn’t listen to students as much as it should, and students need to hold them accountable He brought up the recent vote for the social gatherings ordinance, which students strongly opposed. He said it “makes no sense” that the council decided the way they did after hearing so much student input.

“I’m not condoning student behavior, I’m just saying that you don’t punish thousands of students because of a few bad apples,” Emmanuel said.

Emmanuel hopes that if elected, he can represent all the residents, including the students. He said he hopes the students will consider him “one of them” when they cast their ballots.
