Kate Kennedy,kennedy,District 1,true,"My vision is to help the town attract more people like me, and to become a place where people want to stay."

Kennedy is finishing up her first term as a District 1 representative on the council. The District 1 race is the only one that is uncontested, so she and her colleague, councilman Fazlul Kabir, will continue to serve on the body after the election.

“One of the reasons I run is to build community, and genuine community, amongst my neighbors,” Kennedy said, who moved to College Park in 20142003 after growing up in New Hampshire.

Kennedy said one of her passions is serving on the council’s Committee on Committees, a group that focuses on reorganizing the structure of the committees, which are made up of the city’s residents.

“Committees are one of the best ways residents can engage with the city,” said Kennedy.

While on council, Kennedy said she has helped lead the group in restructuring the nomination process for committees.

Currently, nominations for committees come in sporadically throughout the year, with council members able to nominate residents to serve on a committee at any time. But Kennedy said this system will soon be more centralized.

Kennedy hopes to have all of the committee positions opened once a year, so that there can be a more structured nomination process: a recruitment phase, an application phase and an orientation phase.

She aims to release applications for positions on committees in the spring. She said her job on the Committee on Committees is one of the things she feels she “brings to the table.”
