"One of the reasons I run is to build community, and genuine community, amongst my neighbors."

Kennedy is finishing up her first term as a District 1 representative on the council. The District 1 race is the only one that is uncontested, so she and her colleague, Councilman Fazlul Kabir, will continue to serve on the body after the election.

“One of the reasons I run is to build community, and genuine community, amongst my neighbors,” said Kennedy, who moved to College Park in 2003 after growing up in New Hampshire.

When Kennedy ran two years ago, she said, her platform centered around investments in North College Park. The Duvall Field, Hollywood Streetscape and Hollywood dog park projects are all ones that she has worked on, and hopes to work toward completing in her upcoming term.

She said one of her goals for the city is to be able to create spaces for neighbors to come together, and to be able to connect with one another.

Since being on council, Kennedy said one of her passions has been serving on the council’s Committee on Committees, a group that focuses on reorganizing the structure of the committees, which are made up of the city’s residents.

“Committees are one of the best ways residents can engage with the city,” Kennedy said.

Kennedy said she has helped lead the group in restructuring the nomination process for committees. She said her job on the Committee on Committees is one of the things she feels she “brings to the table.”
