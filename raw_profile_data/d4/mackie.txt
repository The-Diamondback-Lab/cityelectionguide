"This has been my home for so long that I just really care about what’s going on in the city."

Maria Mackie is a long-time District 4 resident running for office for the first time. Mackie grew up in College Park, left to attend college at the University of Delaware, and returned over 20 years ago to live here with her family.

She previously served as the District 4 Board of Elections Supervisor, a Neighborhood Watch Captain and as a member of the West College Park Citizens Association.

“This has been my home for so long that I just really care about what’s going on in the city,” Mackie said. “I want to be part of making College Park a community that people want to come and live here.”

After careers at the Farm Credit Administration and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Mackie became a full-time mom to her five kids. She currently works as an energy consultant, — advising customers on utility options — a tutor and an aging-at-home assistant.

If elected, Mackie intends to focus on affordable housing and residents’ safety and quality of life, such as improving lighting, sidewalks, bike lanes and parks, she said. Mackie also wants to bolster communication with residents by holding focus groups or community meetings to incorporate more input into council decisions.

“College Park is a very diverse city and we have a lot of super awesome people,” she said. “I would really love to use that asset that our city has to make our city a better place.”
